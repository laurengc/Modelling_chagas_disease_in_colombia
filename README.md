# Modelling_chagas_disease_in_colombia
This repository includes code that was used to:
1) Download data
2) Clean, standardise and combine data
3) Predict the vulnerability of regions within Colombia to Chagas disease using random forest
4) Analyse the results

In addition to the code used here, OpenRefine and QGIS was used to create maps of the risk.
